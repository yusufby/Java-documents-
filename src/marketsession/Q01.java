    /*Agile vs Waterfall
        Waterfall does not welcome new changes and updates (customer feedbacks)
        Agile => it is customer oriented and welcomes new changes and updates
        Where do you prefer to work in Agile or Waterfall?
        I work in Agile environment and can do easily with Waterfall as well.
        Scrum team is a self-organized team
        Scrum Master => organize the scrum ceremonies, facilitator for the team
        Product Owner => They are the representative of the business
        they might be also a Stakeholder(may have investment in the project)
        Developers
        Testers
        Dev team => Devs and Testers
        Who decides how many items they can deliver during a sprint?
        Dev Team
        Who decides which items will be delivered?
        PO
        what is the difference between Team capacity and team velocity?
        sprint of 2 weeks
        5 people => 50 points
        velocity => 45 points
        team capacity => is the whole capacity of team members
        velocity => is the actual/ current workers capacity
        5 people
        Ibrahim has 5 points
        4 people => 40
        All we can deliver now is 45 points
        Our team velocity is now 45
        Team capacity => 50
        field in Java => Instance / variable
        we can use store the data and to reach all properties of a class from instances
        class?
        template and blueprint
        we have constructors :
        to initialize class properties(variables)
        we can also initialize super parent properties(variables)
        we can only use class name for custructor
        No return type for constructors
        methods also can be used to initialize or make data manipulations in Java
        methods have return types and void methods
        any name is Okay
        we can do overriding and overloading with methods
        overloading : when we have same name and different  signature for methods, they are overloading methods in the same class
        signature(number of params, type of parameters, order of params)
        Overriding : we have 2 same methods (same name, same signature)
        but one in super type and the other one is in sub type, we call them overriding
        Variables: we use varibales to store data and reach data from specific class
        local variables, static variables
        we can use some access modifiers for class instances
        public, default, private and protected
        public => open to all
        default => same packages
        protected => same package and sub class of other packages
        private => only same class
        final variable: we cannot update the value
        final method : we cannot override it
        final class : we cannot inherit from this class
        finally : we use it after try catch block to have it run if execution passes or fails
        static: it belongs to class, it shares same value everywhere
        we can call them just class name(or using an Object)
        static block: it will execute first on top of everything
        Interface: it allows multiple inheritance. we can have fully abstraction
        Abstract class: we can use abstract class for semi-abstraction
        Interface: no constructor
        no Object creation
        no concrete methods other than static and default methods
        abstract methods
        no protected, default, private variable
        final public static variable by default
        can be implemented multiple times
        Abstract class:
        Constructors
        No Object creation
        abstract methods
        concrete methods
        no multiple inheritance
        OOP concept in Java
        Encapsulation => data hiding
        Inheritance => parent child relationship
        Abstraction => implementation hiding
        Polymorphism => One Object behaves in different shapes / forms
        List <String> list = new ArrayList();
        //Polymorphism
        //Inheritance
        //Abstraction
        list.add("Value");
        String vs Object?
        String name = "Mehmet";//this is a different object
        name = "Fatmanur";//this is a different object
        StringBuilder stb = new StringBuilder();
        stb.append("Ibrahim");
        //Ibrahim to miharbI
        print(stb.toString().equals(stb.reverse().toString()));//false
        When you have a conflict with your Developer, how do you resolve it?
        In a professional environment, nothing is personal and all we collaborate for the team success.
        So when we face smaller issues like this, we first organize a KT and communicate the issues.
        Then we analyse the requirements together to find out common goal.
