        Note 1: When you type code, Java will give you red underlines for some Exceptions before running the code.
              That kind of Exceptions are called "Compile Time Exceptions"(Checked Exception)
              1)FileNotFoundException: This Exception is thrown if the path is wrong or the file does not exist
              2)IOException:This Exception handles all issues related with Input and Output

              Note a: "FileNotFoundException" is the child of "IOException"
              Note b: If there is parent-child relationship between Exception Classes, Child Exception Class must come before
                    Parent Exception Class in multiple catch-block usage.
              Note c: To execute a code block under every condition, put the codes inside the "finally-block"
        Note 2: a) try-block cannot be used alone
                b) try-block can be used with a single catch-block
                c) try-block can be used with multiple catch-block
                d) try-block can be used with just finally-block
                e) try-block can be used with single or multiple catch-block and finally-block
