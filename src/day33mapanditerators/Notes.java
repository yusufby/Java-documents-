			   	hasPrevious() => checks the elements starting from the last index

			   	previous() => get the last element

			   	remove() => delete the current element

			   	next vs hasNext => next returns thelement, but hasNext returns true or
			   	false if element exists or not

			   	hasPrevious vs previous => it returns true or false if the element from last index exists,
			   	but previous will take the last index and give element from last  going through first*/
